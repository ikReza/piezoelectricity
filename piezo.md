## Summary

By using piezoelectric harvesters in the roads we can produce electricity and lessen the consumption of fossil fuels.

## Data Colletion

- A piezoelectric device having dimension of `17 in. x 12 in.` with 44 piezo materials was made.
- Data was collected in the BUET laboratory.

## Data Observation

- Voltage value and current value both are proportional to the applied load value.

  - `voltage ∝ load`
  - `current ∝ load`

- If load increases, voltage and current value also increases.
- `panda` library from python was used to visualize the data and then multiplying the column for voltage and column for current, a column for power values is created.
